BS-Payouts is a program used to process payroll files exported from the Comarch ERP Optima system to the form accepted by the banking system by the NOVUM company. The program reads the list of employees with their salary from files saved in xlsx format, and then assigns a bank account number to each employee. For this purpose, it uses its own database, previously prepared by an employee of the Human Resources department. In the final stage, the data is saved to a text file maintaining the structure required by the banking software.
